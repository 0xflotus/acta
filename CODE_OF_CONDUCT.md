# Contributor Code of Conduct

Don't be an ass.

- Maintainers work for free. Ask politely instead of demanding.
- Our craft is still young and the average developer in the world is very much junior. They will ask beginners questions, they will ignore how to contribute properly. Talk to them as you would talk to your students.
