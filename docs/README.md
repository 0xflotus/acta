Acta is providing:

- A one line straight forward way of subscribing to the application state in a component `Acta.subscribeState('appStateKey', 'localStateKey');`.
- A hook for functional components `const valueFromActa = Acta.useActaState('appStateKey');`
- A simple way of setting / getting the state `Acta.setState({appStateKey: value})`
- A one line straight forward way of subscribing application events in a component `Acta.subscribeState('appEventKey', handler);`.
- A hook for functional components `Acta.useActaEvent('appEventKey', handler);`
- A simple way of dispatching an event `Acta.dispatchEvent('appEventKey', value)`
- Optionnal Local or session storage persistence out of the box.
- Shared state between tabs and windows.
- Great performances since the store contains references to the callbacks instead of having to iterate on every reducer and stop only when it find the corresponding ones.
- Self cleaning methods to unsubscribe to states and events.
- Exposed global object that you can call from anywhere without having to setup and pass providers or decorators.
- Easy debuging from the browser console.
